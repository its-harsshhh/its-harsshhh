# Hi, I’m Harsh 👋

Product designer building real products, learning in public, and experimenting with design + code.  
Focused on UX, systems thinking, and shipping practical solutions.

## What I do
- Design end-to-end product experiences, from problem framing to final UI
- Turn vague ideas into clear user flows and systems
- Build small experiments to learn faster and validate ideas
- Document learnings while working on real problems

---

## What I’m working on right now
- Exploring how AI can assist product design and decision-making
- Building small tools, concepts, and UX experiments
- Improving my product thinking beyond screens and visuals

---

## How I approach products
- Start with user intent, not features
- Think in systems, not just screens
- Ship early, learn fast, iterate openly
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

---

## Repositories you’ll find here
